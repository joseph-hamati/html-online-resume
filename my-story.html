    <h2>How I Started Web Development </h2>
    
    <p>
        My journey into web development began with a curiosity about how websites work. I started by exploring basic HTML and creating simple web pages. As I learned more, I discovered the power of CSS and JavaScript to make websites interactive and visually appealing.

        Over time, I built small projects and practiced regularly. This hands-on experience helped me understand the fundamentals of web development. I continue to learn new technologies and improve my skills every day.

        Web development has become a passion for me, and I am excited to keep growing in this field.
